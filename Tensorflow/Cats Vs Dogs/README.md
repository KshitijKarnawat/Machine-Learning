# Cats Vs Dogs

The [Visualization Code](https://github.com/Nova1323/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Tensorflow/Cats%20Vs%20Dogs/Visualization_Code.ipynb) file is for 
viewing how the images are proccessed in the Neural Network. To view a new image simply run the cell again or change the values of the `FIRST_IMAGE`, `SECOND_IMAGE`,`THIRD_IMAGE`
and `CONVOLUTION_NUMBER`

The Low accuracy and high loss in the [Cats Vs Dogs](https://github.com/Nova1323/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Tensorflow/Cats%20Vs%20Dogs/CatsVsDogs.ipynb) is intented to be as such.
A solution to this will be Image Augmentation and Drop Layer to which the code will be uploaded soon
