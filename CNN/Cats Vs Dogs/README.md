# Cats Vs Dogs

The Low accuracy and high loss in the [Cats Vs Dogs](https://github.com/Nova1323/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Tensorflow/Cats%20Vs%20Dogs/CatsVsDogs.ipynb) is intented to be as such.
A solution to this will be Image Augmentation and Drop Layer to which the code will be uploaded soon
